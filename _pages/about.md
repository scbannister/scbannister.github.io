I am a music psychologist, currently working at a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the School of Music, University of Leeds. Much of my ongoing work is on the Cadenza Project, aiming to improve music listening experiences for those with a hearing loss, through open machine learning challenges and music perception research.

Research Interests and Expertise
======
My research expertise covers music and emotion, perception, social cognition, psychophysiology, and psychoacoustics. I am especially interested in how music can induce emotional goosebumps or chills experiences in listeners, and how music may be used by listeners as a surrogate for social interaction or social relationships.
